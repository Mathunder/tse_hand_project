## Structure

## 3D drawing

The idea of the drawing is to identify the elements that will always be displayed. For example, the fingers will not always be drawn, but the base of the hand will be, so there is no need for it to be coded more than once.  
A finger is to be drawn if the function that is assigned to this specific finger is given the argument `true` and vice versa.
